Exponentiation

Description

Problems involving the computation of exact values of very large magnitude and precision are common. For example, the computation of the national debt is a taxing experience for many computer systems. 

This problem requires that you write a program to compute the exact value of Rn where R is a real number ( 0.0 < R < 99.999 ) and n is an integer such that 0 < n <= 25.
Input

The input will consist of a set of pairs of values for R and n. The R value will occupy columns 1 through 6, and the n value will be in columns 8 and 9.
Output

The output will consist of one line for each line of input giving the exact value of R^n. Leading zeros should be suppressed in the output. Insignificant trailing zeros must not be printed. Don't print the decimal point if the result is an integer.
